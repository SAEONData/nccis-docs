Common branding modifications include the page title, logo and references in the footer. All branding other than imagery will automatically be updated to your region when you specify it in the customisation step. 

You do, however, need to load your logo if you wish to use it. 

Simply drop your image file in the `config` folder (same directory where you modified the `custom_config.js` file). Make sure to name it `logo.png`, alternatively you can refactor the configuration (but you're on your own after that point if you do).
